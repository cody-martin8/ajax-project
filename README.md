# my-recipe-book

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application for home cooks who want to search, create, and save recipes.

# Why I Built This

As someone who enjoys cooking at home and doesn't have the cabinet space for storing tons of recipe books, I wanted to build an application that can be used to find and save good recipes digitally.

## Stretch Features

- I would like this application to be able to display more than just the ingredients and images of saved recipes, such as the directions and nutrition information.

- I would like to add a timer and measurement conversion chart to this application to make it more useful during cooking.
